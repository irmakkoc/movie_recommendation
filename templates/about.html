                <h2>A Letter From Us</h2>
                <p>
                    In MoviOn we made sure to conduct all the necessary research to recommend you movies at the best service. When identifying your emotions, we use the Emotion Wheel which is recognized by psychologists to guide our approach. We focus on the core emotions located at the center of the wheel for the identification.<br><br>
                    Once your emotions are assessed using deep learning and natural language processing, we recommend you movies that will help you get rid of your overwhelming emotions by laughing it off or confronting them. On the other hand, we highly encourage you to maintain your positive emotions, so we recommend movies that will help you with this.<br><br>
                    We hope this system brings comfort and joy to you and your emotions.<br><br>
